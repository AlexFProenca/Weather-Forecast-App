# Weather-Forecast-App
The Weather Forecasting App is a full-stack application that provides users with real-time weather forecasts.
The backend, built with Python, fetches and processes weather data from an external API, while the frontend, developed with React and JavaScript, displays the data in a user-friendly and interactive manner.

Features:

Current Weather: Display the current weather conditions for a specified location.
7-Day Forecast: Provide a detailed 7-day weather forecast.
Search Functionality: Allow users to search for weather information by city or zip code.
Dynamic UI: Use JavaScript for dynamic and interactive UI elements.
